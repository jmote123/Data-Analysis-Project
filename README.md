# Data-Analysis-Project
The company is trying to solve the problem of flight delays in order to increase efficiency and provide better customer experience. The goal of my analysis is to find identify the problems which causes flight delays and making necessary recommendations to overcome that problem. The questions I am trying to answer are listed below:  Which month of the year causes more delayed flight?  Which is the region with most and least flight delay?  Which airlines have the maximum flight delay?  Which days in the week have maximum and minimum delay?  How is departure delayed time related to arrival delayed time?  How does taxi_out time effect delayed flights?  Which Destination airport has maximum delayed flights?  Which city in California has most delayed flight?  Which time of the day has most delayed flights?    Answering these questions matters because airline companies can increase their flight operation efficiency to gain their customer experience and brand value which finally results in higher profits.
